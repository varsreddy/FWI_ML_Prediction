*** Boxplots require numerical data because they are based on statistical measures like median, quartiles, and IQR, which don’t apply to categorical variables. 
   However, categorical features can be used as grouping variables on one axis of a boxplot. 
   For example, we can compare the distribution of Temperature across different Regions using a boxplot.

*** continuous numerical features in your dataset (good for histograms & density plots).

*** Raw plots = show true data distribution (good to see reality + outliers).
*** Log plots = show a compressed distribution (good to reduce skewness and visualize patterns).


*** Histograms → check distributions.
*** Boxplots → confirm outliers & compare groups.
*** Scatterplots / Heatmaps → study relationships between variables.

*** Label Encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables (text labels) into numeric values so that machine learning models can process them. 
    Most ML algorithms cannot work directly with text; they require numbers
